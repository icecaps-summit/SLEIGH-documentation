# Data Summaries {.unnumbered}

This chapter will describe the summarization process applied to the data, prior to its transfer via Iridium satellite network to SANTA (**S**LEIGH **A**ccess **N**ode for data **T**ransfer and **A**nalysis).

**Note:** the data summarisation is a work in process. If a particular instrument isn't described, or the variables for a given instrument won't be sufficient to assess its performance, get in touch with \[who's details, if anyone's, shall we give out on a public website...\].

## Notation

The variables reorded by the instruments will be described in tables below, and the descriptions for the reducing of the data will take the form:

+ The variable name will be described in the `var` collumn, as it is given in the .nc, .dat or .csv files onboard iceman.

+ The dimensions for each variable will be described in the `dims` collumn. For each instrument, the resolution and length of the original dimensions will be described.

+ The data reductions will aggregate data along these dimensions to produce new dimensions, described for each variable in `new_dims`. The resolution and size of these dimensions will also be described.

+ The function(s) used to aggregate the data from `dims` to `new_dims` will be described in the collumn `fn`.

+ A brief description of the use of these reduced variables will be given in the `details` collumn, as well as any other supporting information.
