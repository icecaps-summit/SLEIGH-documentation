## Ice Melt Now
This directory contains weekly composite images of 'cloud masked' brightness temperature over Greenland. It can be used to roughly track the edge of the surface melt front on the Greenland ice sheet. 

The images have also been compiled into a [movie](./greenlandMelt.mp4) of brightness temperatures since 2014.

Interpret 'white' colors as melting, and dark colors as below 0oC temperatures.
