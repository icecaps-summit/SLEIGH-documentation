The Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) is a long-term experiment that has been conducted at Summit Station, Greenland since April 2010. The MEasurements along Langrangian Transects (MELT) is the most recent sub-project of ICECAPS, which was funded for 2022-2024.\nThe instrument platform is called the SLEIGH - Surface-Layer Environmental Instruments for Greenland Hydrology.\nThe SLEIGH includes the following instruments:\n\n\n\nInstrument\nAcronym\n\n\n\n\nCincoze computer\nCincoze\n\n\nAutomated Surface Flux Station\nASFS\n\n\nGround Penetrating Radar\nGPR\n\n\nMicro Rain Radar (MRR)\nMRR\n\n\nMicrowave Radiometer\nMWR\n\n\nSIMB3 thermistor string\nSIMB3\n\n\nVaisala (CL61) Depolarization Lidar\nCL61\n\n\n\nNote that the Cincoze is the main computer system that controls the platform.

There are a couple of different possibilities for how to do this:\n\nFirst remotely log into another computer that is already connected to the Summit Station network (e.g., dataman).\nConnect to the local wifi network while at Summit Station.\n\n\n\nVerizon HotSpot\nThe ICECAPS-MELT project has a Verizon HotSpot that will be connected to the instrument platform when it is deployed in Boulder, Colorado. Researchers will be able to connect to this hotspot using a cellular connection and then log in to have a direct internet connection to the platform.

It was designed to be an autonomous instrument, so the science team anticipates that the platform will not need much attention throughout its summer at Summit. The manual for the platform can be accessed via a web browser on the ICECAPS dataman computer at file:///home/dataman/Documentation/platform/index.html. (Note that Firefox on dataman has a link to this site on its toolbar.) A hard-copy of the manual has been supplied to the current MSF technician.\nThe platform is operated by simply turning it on. It is powered up by turning on the Cincoze computer inside the platform control box (large gray plastic box installed in the middle of the platform). This prodecure is explained in the manual.\nThe platform is currently installed to the southwest of the MSF building.\n\n\nProcedure:\n\nDaily Checks\n\nVisually inspect the platform. If any significant drifting has occurred, take a photo and store this on dataman.\nInspect the MRR antenna. DO NOT clean the antenna but make a note in the Excel logbook of the percentage of the antenna that is covered by snow and/or ice.\nEnsure that data is being archived from the instrument platform onto the dataman computer.\n\n\n\nPower Up/Power Down\n\nThe Startup procedure is shown in the attached manual on page 5.\nThe Shutdown procedure is shown in the attached manual on page 5. (Note that one must log into the Cincoze computer to properly shutdown the platform. The login procedure is shown on pages 7 and 8 of the attached manual.)\n\n\n\nRetro:\n\nThe instrument platform will be completely retro’d by our science team in August 2023.\n\n\n\nConsumable Resupply Items:\n\nThere are no consumable supplied for the instrument platform.",

It runs on port 8888, which is the default port used by Jupyter.\n\nTo avoid, conflicting with a possible Jupyter server on your local computer, type the following command on your local computer to forward the Jupyter server to another port on your local computer:\nssh -L 7777:localhost:8888 iceman\nTo keep this SSH connection active, type top in the terminal running SSH once you’re logged in to iceman. This provides a more responsive web browser experience.\nNow connect to the Jupyter Server on the Cincoze by navigating your local browser to\nlocalhost:7777\n\nPlease note that this connection can take a long time (minutes).

    "text": "Setting up the Windows VM on the Cincoze\nFrom Michael G. on 11/29/2023:\n\nThere are two ways to use qemu. Without assistance and using libvirt. For the VM I'm using bare qemu without any virtualization management. It's a bit harder to set up (no gui) but it's lower level and much easier to run as a service or modify. There are three key files.\n\n~/.config/systemd/user/qemu@.service\n~/.config/qemu/windows.conf\n/data/vm/windows_vm.qcow\n\nYou start the VM, or shut it down, with \"systemctl --user start qemu@windows.service\"... the @windows part specifies the config file that's written above. FYI, the config uses a tap-bridge connection to run a \"parallel\" virtual NIC so that the VM appears as if it were a separate machine on the network. This is much easier than trying to port forward anything you need, although there is a qemu conf file in there that shows how to do port forward stuff. For a laptop that generally works better because you can only run a tap-bridge with an ethernet interface, not wifi.\n\nFinally FYI, something about my tap-bridge config broke with the updated OS and I need to figure that out. I just noticed it. I'll try to fix that soon.\n\n\"Connecting\" to the VM remotely can be done with vncviewer or with remote desktop. This is pretty straightforward using ssh port forwarding. The VNC server is on the Linux side (192.168.1.10:5901) and the remote desktop is on the VM side once I fix the tap-bridge (192.168.1.166).",
