The Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) is a long-term experiment that has been conducted at Summit Station, Greenland since April 2010. The MEasurements along Langrangian Transects (MELT) is the most recent sub-project of ICECAPS, which was funded for 2022-2024.\nThe instrument platform is called the SLEIGH - Surface-Layer Environmental Instruments for Greenland Hydrology.\nThe SLEIGH includes the following instruments:\n\n\n\nInstrument\nAcronym\n\n\n\n\nCincoze computer\nCincoze\n\n\nAutomated Surface Flux Station\nASFS\n\n\nGround Penetrating Radar\nGPR\n\n\nMicro Rain Radar (MRR)\nMRR\n\n\nMicrowave Radiometer\nMWR\n\n\nSIMB3 thermistor string\nSIMB3\n\n\nVaisala (CL61) Depolarization Lidar\nCL61\n\n\n\nNote that the Cincoze is the main computer system that controls the platform. All of the other instruments interface to it. In addition to controlling the platform, the Cincoze handles all of the raw data archival.\nThe ASFS itself is composed of a series of additional instruments:\n\n\n\nASFS Instruments\nAcronym\n\n\n\n\nBroadband Radiometers\nBRad\n\n\nMeteorological instrument (T,P,U)\nMet\n\n\nMetek Sonic Anemometer\nMetek\n\n\nLicor gas analyzer\nLicor\n\n\nGlobal Positioning System\nGPS\n\n\nFlux plates\nFPlt",

    "text": "Setting up the Windows VM on the Cincoze\nFrom Michael G. on 11/29/2023:\n\nThere are two ways to use qemu. Without assistance and using libvirt. For the VM I'm using bare qemu without any virtualization management. It's a bit harder to set up (no gui) but it's lower level and much easier to run as a service or modify. There are three key files.\n\n~/.config/systemd/user/qemu@.service\n~/.config/qemu/windows.conf\n/data/vm/windows_vm.qcow\n\nYou start the VM, or shut it down, with \"systemctl --user start qemu@windows.service\"... the @windows part specifies the config file that's written above. FYI, the config uses a tap-bridge connection to run a \"parallel\" virtual NIC so that the VM appears as if it were a separate machine on the network. This is much easier than trying to port forward anything you need, although there is a qemu conf file in there that shows how to do port forward stuff. For a laptop that generally works better because you can only run a tap-bridge with an ethernet interface, not wifi.\n\nFinally FYI, something about my tap-bridge config broke with the updated OS and I need to figure that out. I just noticed it. I'll try to fix that soon.\n\n\"Connecting\" to the VM remotely can be done with vncviewer or with remote desktop. This is pretty straightforward using ssh port forwarding. The VNC server is on the Linux side (192.168.1.10:5901) and the remote desktop is on the VM side once I fix the tap-bridge (192.168.1.166).",

The render location can be set to the hosted website’s location on SANTA. This will automatically update a static quarto render to display the latest available data.\n\nThere are a few considerations to implement this procedure: - We need to decide on a timeframe after which the quarto render is reran to keep the website up to date. 15 minutes would ensure that as a minimum time delay between a data downlink and it being publicly viewable. - We need a way to ensure that data isn’t read as its being written from the SLEIGH.
