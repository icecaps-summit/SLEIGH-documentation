## Ice Melt Now
You can view weekly composite images of 'cloud masked' brightness temperature over Greenland [here](./images/iceMeltNow/). These images can be used to roughly track the edge of the extent of surface melt on the Greenland ice sheet from 2014 to present. 

The images have also been compiled into a [movie](./images/iceMeltNow/greenlandMelt.mp4) of brightness temperatures since 2014.

Interpret 'white' colors as melting, and dark colors as below 0oC temperatures.
